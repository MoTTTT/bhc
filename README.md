# Bore-hole controller

The client for this project had a bore-hole filed with many boreholes, situated in the Atlantis dunes an hour outside of Cape Town.

An existing ageing solution needed to be replaced.

The following sensors were supported:

- Rate of flow: a pulse was received per litre of water flowing through the sensor.
- Pump temperature
- Water pressure in several places

The following controls were implemented:

- Several valves
- Pump power

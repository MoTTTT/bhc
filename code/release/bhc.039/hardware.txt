CPU Card
	Mechanical:
		Test:	Program and check functionality
			Card not working at times for long periods.
			Sensitive to movement.
			Short/Disconnection suspected.
			Correct funct. restored during address bus probe
				Broken IC socket pin on 80c552
				Repaired (temorary)
				Card working more reliably.
		QFix:	Pressing on 573 restores correct functionality.
		Debug:	Visual inspection
			Card dirty (solder flux residual)
				Card cleaned with solvent
				Less intermittent failure.
		Problems persist.
		Fix:	Install 74139. Also fixes RAM problems.
		Test Complete OK.
	EPROM (Emulated):
		Test:	Lower 32K block.
			Lower 32K Program memmory working. (ie 9370 byte
			executable, located in data space from
			location 0x00, functions correctly)
		Testing Complete OK.
	RAM:
		Test:	Lower 32K block.
			XDATA located at 0x0000 does not work as designed
				Same result when control engine etc disabled.
			XDATA located from 0x0200 up works correctly
		Test Failed.
			Reason for incorrect opperation not determined.
			Further testing with XDATA located from 0x0200
		Fix:	U20 Installed.( Banked RAM chip selection.)
			XDATA located at 0x0000 works correctly.
		Testing complete, fixed.
	I2C bus
		Test:	Connect to remote LcdPad
			Blown Hardware detected, repaired.
			Long I2C bus cable causing unreliable communication.
			Reliable I2C bus communication with the LcdPad
			achieved for short (~1m) cable lengths.
		Testing Complete, fixed.
	Analog to Digital Conversion
		Test:	Analog channels 0, 1, and 2, and Vref
			Vref at ~2V.
			Vref at ~3.5V after 12V rail fixed. (Glen)
			Vref measuring ~5V on occasion
			Emulated signal measurable on controller pins.
			ADC reading 0xFF (or 0x00 at startup).
				80C552 ADC port blown?
			Try fresh microcontroller? No Change
			Analog card settings changed
			Readings working only on channels 0, 1
				No signal at channel 2
				Channel 2 assigned to Pressure.
				No fualt detection/ repair.
			ADC readings erratic at times.
		Test Failed, but sub-system usable.
	RS232 bus
		Test:	Sending data at 19200
			Data received on terminal emulator
		Testing Complete.
	Timers
		Test:	Sending pulses to TIMER0A..B ie T0
			No connection from J14 to T0 (pin 28 on U25)
			No pin evident on solder side of card.
			Using TIMER1A..B to T1
		Test failed, but sub-system usable.
Analog Card
	Mechanical:	Card difficult to insert into casing.
	Settings:	Card Addressed using CS1 (ie jumper J01 on)
			Low order address 0x?F
			With analog select, address is 0xF02F
	Usage:		Enable analog output to controller by writing 
				enable mask to XDATA 0xF02F
				(ie write 0xFF at startup)
	Test:		Analog output switched succesfully.
			Analog voltage measured at microcontroller,
				varying with emulator setting.
	Testing Complete.
	Card stripped:	14 ICs removed, only U06..U09 remain.
			Links inserted in IC socket U20 1-2,3-4,8-9
Digital Card
	Mechanical:	Leads too long (solder side): Leads clipped
			R16 not solder both sides (Din8+)
	Settings:	Card addressed using CS2 (ie jumper J02 on)
			Low order address 0x?F (ie jumper J09..J012 off)
	Output Usage:	Write control output (one byte) to XDATA 0xF20F
	Input Usage:	Read data (one byte) from XDATA 0xF20F
	Output Test:	Relays switching on power up
			Relays switching (audio inspection) on writing to latch
			Emulator led's not following relay setting
		Debug:	Card not working in first slot
			Card not working in absence of ADC card
			Need extender board to debug Digital card
			Extender Card inserted
			TP03 (12V rail) measures 3.06V: Extender board loss?
			Check relay pinouts.
			12V power rail missing.
			15V regulator used to replace 12V regulator on PSU
			Output switching detected on simulator LEDs
	Input Test:	Reading byte from digital input latch.
			Bit 2 and 7 shorted, simulator?
	Test Failed, but sub-system usable.
Housing
	Test:	Mechanical Usability ( Software Development )
		Cards sticking on insertion/removal
		No cover
		Shorting to solder side leads on bottom card
			Leads too long
			Leads clipped.
			Solved.
		Shorting to top card solder side leads
			No top cover: top card has no slot
			Foam and paper insulators used.
			Solved.
	Test:	Measure potential 
		Chassis Voltage level intermittently floating, 5V etc
			sensitive to simulator connection and 
			physical movement
		Housing not grounded
			PSU not assembled into housing
			Glen: Regulators will be bolted to the chassis
	Test Failed, but sub-system repaired/ usable.
PSU
	Emulator used as supplied, on 20V rail.
		Fuse blows on connection of digital emulator
		Replace fuse
		Connect emulator to 5V rail
	Controller unit used as supplied, on 24V rail
		12V regulator blown
		12V Regulator replaced with 15V (Glen)
		Regulator still overheating
		Controller unit moved to 24V rail (Glen)
	Testing Complete.
Emulator
	Pannel mount connection method unstable, freeing connectors.
		Wiring breakages at solder joints - resoldered
	No Documentation.
	Timer wired to I2C bus on CON01.

		RTC blown, removed
		Replacement Oscillator assembled on solderless breadboard
	LEDs default to on when connected, 4th LED off: Jumper setting.
	Switching relays not changing LED output: Fixed.
	Test Failed, but sub-system usable.

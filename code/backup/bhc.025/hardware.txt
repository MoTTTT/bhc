CPU Card
	EPROM (Emulated)
		Lower 32K Program memmory working. (ie 9370 byte executable,
		located in data space from locateion 0x00, functions
		correctly)
	RAM	
I2C bus
	Blown Hardware detected, repaired.
	Long I2C bus cable causing unreliable communication.
	Reliable I2C bus communication with the LcdPad
		achieved for short (~1m) cable lengths.
	Testing Complete.
Analog Card
	Settings:	Card Addressed using CS1 (ie jumper J01 on)
			Low order address 0x?F
			With analog select, address is 0xF02F
	Usage:		Enable analog output to controller by writing 
				enable mask to XDATA 0xF02F
				(ie write 0xFF at startup)
	Test:		Analog output switched succesfully.
			Analog voltage measured at microcontroller,
				varying with emulator setting.
	Testing Complete.
Analogs
	Vref at ~2V.
	Emulated signal measurable on controller pins.
	ADC reading 0xFF (or 0x00 at startup) for all input values.
		80C552 ADC port blown?

Digital Card
	Mechanical:	Leads too long (solder side)
			R16 not solder both sides (Din8+)
	Settings:	Card addressed using CS2 (ie jumper J02 on)
			Low order address 0x?F (ie jumper J09..J012 off)
	Usage:		Write control output (one byte) to XDATA 0xF20F
	Test:		Relays switching on power up
			Relays switching (audio inspection) on writing to latch
			Emulator led's not following relay setting
	Debug:		Card not working in first slot
			Card not working in absence of ADC card
			Need extender board to debug Digital card
Housing
	Chassis Voltage level intermittently floating, 5V etc
		sensitive to simulator connection and physical movement
PSU
	Emulator used as supplied, on 20V rail.
		Fuse blows on connection of digital emulator
		Replace fuse
		Connect emulator to 5V rail
	Intermittent physical connection/signal evident with led output state
		sensitive to movement of the digital card. Leads too long?
	Chassis at 5V with ADC emulator plugged in
Emulator
	Pannel mount connection method unstable, freeing connectors.
		Wiring breakages at solder joints - resoldered
	No Documentation.
	Timer wired to I2C bus on CON01.
		Timer disconnected
		80C552 blown, replaced
		RTC blown, removed
	LEDs default to on when connected, 4th LED off.
	Switching relays not changing LED output
